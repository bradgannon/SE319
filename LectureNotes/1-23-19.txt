*Server and Client Terms and Definitions*

- Server

	Program that provides SERVICES (i.e. useful functionality). Typically, keeps running forever.
		Typically, the computer that runs the server program is called a server. Many server programs can be running on a single computer.
	
	Examples of services:
		Database services
		Runs a website

- Client

	Program that connects to a SERVER computer - and then to a program that provides services and USES those services

- MAC ID - IP Address - Hostname

	MAC ID is a unique ID that is HARD-CODED on every computer (or internet capable device)
		Already there when you buy the device
		Used by lower protocols to uniquely identify a device
		Example c8:bc:c8:9b:c4:0f
	
	IP ADDRESS is an address assigned to computers connected to the internet
		Typically assigned when connecting to the internet
		Example 129.186.252.23
		
	Unlike IP address, HOSTNAME is a human-readable address, like https://www.google.com/
	Servers typically have hostnames
	
- DNS, Localhost

	DNS (Domain Name Server) - is like a phone book.
		Maps Hostnames to IP addresses (many to one)
		When you want to connect to website by typing in hostname, computer will find IP address via DNS
		
	Localhost - each computer can use the hostname localhost to refer to itself
	
- Port

	This is a number that refers to a specific process running on a computer
	Many port numbers are reserved:
		80: http
		23: telnet
		22: ssh
		110: pop3 (for email delivery)
	You will be able to create ports from only 1024 onwards
	Once a port is being used by a server, you cannot use that same port for other programs
	Multiple clients can talk to a server through that port
	
- Socket

	A socket contains connection information between two computers
	Local Address:
		Local computer's IP address
		Local program's port number
	Remote Address:
		Remote computer's IP address
		Remote program's port number
	Protocol:
		Means the 'language' or 'rules' that the two computers will use to communicate
		Typically this is TCP/IP protocol

- Demonstration
	
	Telnet is disabled on most servers for security reasons
	Server @ CS Dep ISU
		To login to pyrite, you muse use the Secure Shell (ssh)
		ssh <ISU NetID>@pyrite.cs.iastate.edu
		Ctrl-d usually allows you to exit the ssh session normally (logout)
	Condo Cluster @ ISU (High-performance computing cluster)
		ssh <ISU NetID>@condo2017.its.iastate.edu
	Can access above features via bash script
	
*Web Server and Clients*

- Web server and client, HTTP request

	Web-client and Web-server communicates using HTTP protocol
		Client can send a HTTP request: method 'get' or 'post'
		Server can send a HTTP request and product HTTP response
	Server side programs should be capable of reading HTTP request and producing HTTP response
	Command: GET request-URI HTTP-version

- Demonstration

	HTML
	DOM (Document Object Model): An application programming interface (API) for HTML
		It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated
